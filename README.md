# CS210 Data Science Project
## Spotify Song & Genre Analysis, Popularity Prediction and a Recommendation System
* Manipulated the data of Spotify to analyze user habits and preferences with Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib). Developed a recommendation system based on user preferences with a simple ML algorithm, within the scope of Data Science course from Sabancı University Spring'21.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizations descriptive statistics of the dataset; visual explanations of features & sharing distributions
- Example visualizations of aggregated forms based on features
- Analysis of the most popular artists and songs
- Analyzing how songs of different genres change with time (Temporal analysis of features)

### Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing
- Statistical tests to check how (or if) features contribute to popularity of songs
- Statistical tests to check if significant differences exist between different eras (like comparing features of 80s and 90s hip-hop)

### Machine Learning
- Prediction of song popularity with various machine learning models
- Efforts on hyper-parameter tuning to increase the performance of models
- Creating a simple song recommendation system using similarity metrics and Nearest Neighbors methods
